Monitor Opnsense by API with Zabbix

As the current opnsense Template for Zabbix does not work anymore I want to create a new one which uses the opnsnse-API to get all data.
First steps are to have a template which connects to the API and checks the basic status.


Warning. Current version is an very early proof of concept. Dont use it!

Anyone who wants to play with this.
Import Template and set macros for $KEY, $ROUTER_URL and $SECRET.
You need to create an API-Key on your opnsense to get the values needed!
